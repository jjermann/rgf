Big things / things I can't do alone:
-------------------------------------
- (MAIN) integrate it into kaya.gs
- think about html elements and how to handle them: css/dynamic html/etc...
- Streams, recording from microphone/webcame/webstream/etc
- make a nice media stream/game stream interface design
- add all necessary interface elements to kaya.gs (menu/buttons/etc)
  at the right position (maybe with dynamic size).
- maybe: change the spec to support game streams at non game-info nodes
  (should be possible but do we want this?)...
 

Medium things:
--------------
- [DONE?] finnish KeyFrame support
- write tester for MediaStream, MediaInterface
- (BUG) find out why the "node" comparison doesn't work...
- When inserting an action the current status.time is used. Since the time
  interval is usually not so small (~250ms) an insertion might fail because
  it was attempted too quickly.

  Solution 1:
  Use the current time (not status.time) for everything, resp. update the
  time to the current time for each insertion (makes more sense).
  This has the disadvantage, that with this update the whole board might
  change (it was based on status.time) so the move might no longer make any
  sense from that new situation.

  Solution 2:
  As above we update the time but only if the new time does not cause any
  changes (e.g. its time is still lower then the next action time),
  otherwise we (update the time and?) return false.

  Solution 3:
  Reduce the update interval to something much smaller than 250ms...

- [DONE] Add support for updates within the same time (updates of time_index)
- Add "step back" and "step forward" buttons which step back/forward one action.
- Replay with constant time for each action instead of a time accurate replay.
- Support loading linear SGF files as an RGF file by interpreting the "time
  left" properties accordingly... -> thus supporting time accurate replays
  of linear games even if it was not recorded with timestamps...
- Undo/Redo?
- Write a GSEditInterface?:
  It consists of a bar of a certain length, where length might be a time
  duration or something bounded by a certain maximal amount of actions...
  In that bar we visually represent each action and allow operations:
  o Use e.g. different colors to indicate different types of actions...
  o Update the bar when we update the time...
  o Selection of Action(s)
  o Insertion and Deletion of Action(s)?
  o Drag and drop of action(s) (within the time interval of its
    neighbouring actions).


Small things:
-------------

- [DONE] (BUG) bug when printing property lists
- At the moment no property lists are allowed for timestamped nodes (but not
  they are not really needed either)...
- Allow time delay for media stream -> adjust status.currentTime accordingly
  (as if there was no delay)!
