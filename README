RGF
===

RGF stands fo Recording Game Format. It could be considered an extension
of the SGF file format. It is mainly intended for the game "Go" but might
be used for other games as well if possible.

An RGF file is stored besides a given SGF file, optionally together its   
corresponding media stream file(s). It describes a time-accurate recording
of a game or a lecture, possibly with an associated media (audio or video)
stream. There might be several RGF (and corresponding media) files.
Each such file is referenced in a game-info node in the SGF file which also 
contains all of its "header" information, stored in two new properties (GS
and MS, see below). If those properties are properly set we call such a node
a game stream node.

The syntax of the RGF file (see below) is very similar to the SGF syntax but
it is NOT strictly backwards compatible to SGF. The SGF file remains valid
though. All files are bundled together in a .tar file which gets the file
extension .rgt. Consequently this "overall" file format is named RGT.
If it is further compressed with gzip (.tar.gz) the extension is .rgz.
