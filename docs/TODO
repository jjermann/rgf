Big things / things I can't do alone:
-------------------------------------
- (MAIN) integrate it into kaya.gs
- how is the interaction with viewers in a lecture?
- think about html elements and how to handle them: css/dynamic html/etc...
- Streams, recording from microphone/webcame/webstream/etc => webRTC
- make a nice media stream/game stream interface design
- add all necessary interface elements to kaya.gs (menu/buttons/etc)
  at the right position (maybe with dynamic size).


Medium things:
--------------
- Implement a proper fallback mechanism for the MediaStream
- Maybe the GameStream should itself implement KeyFrames if a certain
  "KeyFrame" distance is reached, it would have to call the board for
  this...
- Increase the performance of seeking
  1. Rremove debug output
  2. Don't draw the board for each update, only at the end
  3. Implement KeyFrames
- Add more basic checks whether arguments make sense and act accordingly
  (e.g. path descend)...
- Implement and test KeyFrames
- Remove all actions if there is an insertion failed during an attempt to
  apply an action list...
- write tester for MediaStream, MediaInterface, maybe also for RGFNode
- complete the tester for GameStream
- Write a GSEditInterface?:
  It consists of a bar of a certain length, where length might be a time
  duration or something bounded by a certain maximal amount of actions...
  In that bar we visually represent each action and allow operations:
  o Use e.g. different colors to indicate different types of actions...
  o Update the bar when we update the time...
  o Selection of Action(s)
  o Insertion and Deletion of Action(s)?
  o Drag and drop of action(s) (within the time interval of its
    neighbouring actions).


Small things:
-------------
- Test the removal of actions from the tree and the list
- (BUG) find out why the "node" comparison doesn't work...
- Finnish and polish the linear SGF import tool, i.e. implement other time modes
  like fischer, hourglass, japanese/canadian byo-yomi
- Replay with constant time for each action instead of a time accurate replay.
- "round" times up to 1 ms: Where?!
- (BUG) escape character for "]", also be careful about "\\]"...


Unsure:
-------
- Allow game stream node to be anywhere (except inside an already existing
  game stream subtree), this is probably a good idea and would allow
  standalone rgf files without sgf files and (if no media is present) even
  without a tar container... but it has some negative aspects too, for
  instance: an sgf reader would not have access to important "header"
  informations of the rgf game (so we would have to think about this
  carefully)...
- How is the header (and what part of it?) passed on to the MediaStream and GameStream?
- Make meaning of "Duration" in all possible context more clear + working
- Undo/Redo?
- At the moment no property lists are allowed for timestamped nodes (but not
  they are not really needed either)...
- Allow time delay for media stream -> adjust status.currentTime accordingly
  (as if there was no delay)!
- Version property for RGF?
- additional media property for RGF?
